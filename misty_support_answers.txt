Hi. Is there a way to assign a default skill to run after powering up?
In other words, if one develops a general personality skill (i.e. roam
the room with obstacle avoidance and some basic personality: sounds,
head movement etc.) then is there a way to launch this skill
automatically when Misty is powered on?

You can set a skill to run automatically when Misty boots up by adding
the string “Startup” to the StartupRules array in the meta file for
your skill. There is a bit more information about this functionality
in the meta file documentation.
